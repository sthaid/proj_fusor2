INTRODUCTION
===============================================

This software is comprised of 2 programs:
- get_neutron_data: reads neutron pulse data from an ADC, scans the data for pulses,
                    and sends the pulse info to the display program using a TCP
                    WIFI connection
- display:          receives the neutron pulse data from the get_neutron_data program;
                    also obtains fusor voltage, current, pressure, and grid image;
                    and displays and records the data

These 2 programs are run on seperate Raspberry Pi computers.

    ADC1: Dataq Instruments DI-149. Specs: 10 kHz max sample rate, differential inputs.

    ADC2: Measurement Computing USB-204. Specs 500 kHz max sample rate. SE Analog inputs.
        This needs to be high sample rate because the pulses from the Ludlum scaler are only
        about 2 us wide.

    Pirani: analog output voltage from Kurt J Lesker 275i Pirani Gauge

    Ludlum Scaler:  Ludlum 2929 Dual channel scaler.  This scaler has an Amp Out BNC 
        connector, which is connected to ADC-2 through Resistor R.

    Webcam: Logitech HD Laptop Webcam C615, 1080p.
        "Premium autofocus for razor sharp images, even in close ups,"

    Bluetooth Multimeters: 2x of Owon B35T Digital Multimeter with Bluetooth Interface.
        The meter monitoring Fusor HV is set to measure microamps, and is connected in
        series with the 1G ohm resistor. The meter monitoring Fusor Current is set to 
        measure milliamps, and is connected between ground and the ground connection of
        the power supply voltage multiplier.
